web application for independent artists.
Currently in the art economy there is a huge supply but a low demand for artwork. More than ever people are starting to experiment with art which in turn creates a low demand. Reputation is important in the art economy. Van Gogh web application allows artists to upload/market their artwork. Artists benefit by being able to expand their brand and build their reputation.
